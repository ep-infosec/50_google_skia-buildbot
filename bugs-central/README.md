Bugs Central
============

Skia has many clients (eg: Android, Flutter native+web, Chromium, Skia itself),
those clients use different issue trackers and different queries within those
trackers.

Bugs central keeps track of Skia bugs in Skia's major clients + issue trackers.

Design doc is [here](https://goto.google.com/skia-bugs-central).
