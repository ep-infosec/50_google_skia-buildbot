# Role Name

`install_alert_to_pubsub`

## Description

Builds alert-to-pubsub and deploys it to each of the jumphosts.

## Arguments

alert_to_pubsub_ansible_version - Optional argument to select the version of
alert_to_pubsub_ansible to install. If not set then the version recorded in the
k8s-config repo will be used.

## Requirements

The default service account key for `chrome-bot` must have permissions to push
PubSub messages to the alert topic.

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: jumphosts

      roles:
        - install_alert_to_pubsub

## Pushing a test/debug binary:

To deploy a test/debug binary to a machine first upload the cipd package via the
//skolo Makefile:

```
$ cd am
$ make build_and_upload_alert_to_pubsub_ansible
```

Then visit http://go/cipd/p/skia/internal/alert_to_pubsub_ansible/+/ to find the
version for that build and pass it to a playbook via --extra-vars.

For example:

```
$ ansible-playbook ./switchboard/jumphosts.yml \
  --extra-vars alert_to_pubsub_version_override=2021-09-19T15:36:31Z-jcgregorio-ba7510fdcda7d3979cc2c0df21fee100e3ba4075-dirty
```
