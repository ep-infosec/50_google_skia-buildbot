# Downloaded from https://www.nvidia.com/download/find.aspx. At the time of writing, this is the
# latest driver that supports RTX 30 series GPUs. To make sure this driver is compatible with our
# older Nvidia GPUs, I searched for drivers for GTX 900 series GPUs. The search results included
# this driver as well, so it should work across our entire Nvidia GPU fleet.
