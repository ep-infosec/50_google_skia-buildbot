# Prevent systemd from giving up restarting the service if it keeps crashing. This is useful e.g.
# when power is restored after a power outage, but internet connectivity hasn't been restored yet,
# causing services that depend on external APIs to repeatedly crash until access to the internet is
# restored.
#
# These settings tell systemd to restart the crashing service every 10 seconds (see RestartSec=
# below), and to stop trying to restart it if it crashes more than 1000 times (StartLimitBurst=)
# within an interval of 1 second (StartLimitIntervalSec=), effectively never giving up.
