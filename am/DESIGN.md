alert-manager
=============

Alert manager converts Prometheus alerts into PubSub events which
are then used to drive the state in alert-manager.

```

The alert-manager application is state-less, all state is stored
in the Cloud Datastore. Also, all the logic for applying silences
to Incidents is done in the UI, i.e. the alert-manager backend
just reads and writes Incidents and Silences without looking at
the interactions between the two.
